	To create a new migration:
	1. First do changes in code and DB context
	2. Open console in cmd or integrated in VS and ensure that your location the solution directory
	3. Copy this command: dotnet ef migrations add [MigrationName] --project .\AiCoreApi\AiCoreApi.csproj --startup-project .\AiCoreApi\AiCoreApi.csproj
	4. Replace [MigrationName] with your name
	5. Run migration
	6. When successed open new migration file in Migration folder
	7. Find two methods Up and Down.
	8. Add logic there
	9. Test
	10. Repeat steps above if necessary


	Note: Sometime migration for some reason can have issues. If you got error with 
	      unresolved classes in Db please try to remove bin and obj folders and try again.


    Important for all devs: 
		Try to avoid implement any complecated logic in constructors
		because DI mechanism when resolveing object will call what inside of it
		that can cause unpredictable errors
